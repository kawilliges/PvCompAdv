Description: Calculates (for all locations on the globe) the potential cost of 
    PV electricity, PV coverage, and unit cost of electricity for an autarky
    (no trade) case, as well as the respective results in cases of 
    interhemispheric (e.g. N-S, E-W, global grid) trade. The package requires 
    input data in the form of global potential PV production, the calculated 
    size of a winter hole, and calculated values of S/G and overcapacity factor
    (OCF). Additionally, the user supplies the estimated costs of baselaod / 
    backup generation, capital recovery factors for PV and baseload, and the 
    spatial extent (min/max latitude) of interest.
